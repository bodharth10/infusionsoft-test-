Hello Manny, 

We are using two methods(scopes) for groups : 

1) user_managed_groups : we are using this scope to list the number of associated groups to fb profile . 

2) publish_to_groups : we are using this scope for posting content/campaign on user facebook groups .


Thanks,

Maropost Markting Cloud is a cross-channel marketing automation platform.  Our clients are typically B2C Marketers.  They use our platform for automated marketing messaging via email, SMS, mobile messaging, and social content.

Many of our clients are Social Media Marketers who are responsible to manage the content posted to their company's Facebook Pages and Facebook Groups.  We need approval to access the Facebook Groups API in order to allow our clients to:
1) Establish the connection between Maropost Marketing Cloud and the Facebook Group that they manage, and 
2) To post content created within Maropost Marketing Cloud to their Facebook Group so that group members may see the informative content.

I have uploaded a short video showing your how our platform works and the reason why we need your approval to access the Facebook Groups API.

If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me at manny@maropost.com.
